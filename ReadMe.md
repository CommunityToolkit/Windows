## Getting Started

### [Try out our Sample App live in your browser!](https://toolkitlabs.dev)

Please read the [Getting Started with the Windows Community Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit/getting-started) page for more detailed information about using the toolkit.

## Clone the repository

The [tooling](https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Tooling-Windows-Submodule) is in a submodule, so you'll need to use `--recurse-submodules` when cloning or pulling for the first time:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/CommunityToolkit/Labs-Windows.git
```

## 📦 NuGet Packages

NuGet is a standard package manager for .NET applications which is built into Visual Studio. When you open solution in Visual Studio, choose the *Tools* menu > *NuGet Package Manager* > *Manage NuGet packages for solution…* Enter one of the package names mentioned in [Windows Community Toolkit NuGet Packages](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/communitytoolkit/nuget-packages) table to search for it online.

## 📫 Features <a name="supported"></a>

The [Features list](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/WindowsCommunityToolkitDocs/blob/master/docs/toc.md#controls) refers to all the currently available features that can be found in the Windows Community Toolkit. Most features should work with the October 2018 Update (1809) SDK 17763 and above; however, refer to specific documentation on each feature for more information.

## 💠 Principles

1. The toolkit will provide features that are needed for a wide-array of developers, are easy-to-use, and maintainable.
2. As soon as a comparable feature is available in the Windows SDK for Windows, it will be marked as deprecated.
3. We will fix issues forward and stay up-to-date on top of WinUI 2 and 3 updates supporting the minimum OS level that they also support.
