<!--
    WinUI 2 under UWP uses TargetFramework uap10.0.*
    WinUI 3 under WinAppSdk uses TargetFramework net6.0-windows10.*
    However, under Uno-powered platforms, both WinUI 2 and 3 can share the same TargetFramework.
    
    MSBuild doesn't play nicely with this out of the box, so we've made it easy for you.

    For .NET Standard packages, you can use the Nuget Package Manager in Visual Studio.
    For UWP / WinAppSDK / Uno packages, place the package references here.
