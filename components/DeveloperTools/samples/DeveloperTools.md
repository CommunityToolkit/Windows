## AlignmentGrid XAML Control

The [AlignmentGrid Control](/dotnet/api/microsoft.toolkit.uwp.developertools.alignmentgrid) can be used to display a grid to help with aligning controls.

You can control the grid's steps with `HorizontalStep` and `VerticalStep` properties. Line color can be defined with `LineBrush` property.
