The `FadeHeaderBehavior`, `QuickReturnHeaderBehavior`, and `StickyHeaderBehavior` apply behaviors to `ListView`, `GridView`, and `HeaderedTreeView` Headers.

## FadeHeaderBehavior

The FadeHeaderBehavior causes the Header of the scrolling collection to fade in and out as the user scrolls at the top of the collection.

## QuickReturnBehavior

The QuickReturnHeaderBehavior causes the Header of the scrolling collection to return back into view as soon as the user scrolls up even if they are not near the top of the collection.

## StickyHeaderBehavior

The StickyHeaderBehavior causes the Header of the scrolling collection to stay in view as the user scrolls up and down in the collection.
