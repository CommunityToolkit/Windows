        The easier we can reproduce the issue, the easier it is to understand and fix the problem. 
        Provide repro steps, code-snippets, or a standalone project to help us understand the issue you're facing.
        
        If the problem can be reproduced in our [Sample Gallery](https://aka.ms/windowstoolkitapp), you can speed up creation of a functional repro by forking the toolkit and adding or modifying a test or sample. Link to the forked repo and branch.

        Example repro steps:
        1. Given the following environment (Sample App w/ XAML, Project with Isolated setup, etc...)
        2. Go to '...'
        3. Click on '....'
        4. Scroll down to '....'
        5. See error
